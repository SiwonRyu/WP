**Abstract:** This study analyzes the identification and estimation of treatment effects, explicitly considering network changes resulting from the treatment. Compared to the classical literature that assumes independent units, recent studies emphasize the significance of spillover effects. However, these studies often assume that the underlying network is fixed or unaffected by treatment. Meanwhile, there is empirical evidence suggesting that treatment can also affect the network. The purpose of this study is to estimate the causal treatment and spillover effects accounting for the causal network changes from the treatment. The main contribution of this study is the decomposition of the causal effects into two distinct parts: the effect of treatment when the network remains unchanged and the effect when only the network structure is changed by the treatment. This approach enhances our understanding of the mechanisms of a policy or program by considering counterfactual scenarios in which the network is changed or unchanged due to treatment. Additionally, the study addresses quasi-experimental situations, providing a Difference-in-Differences approach.
