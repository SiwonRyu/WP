**Abstract:** Recent empirical studies emphasize the importance of indirect, or spillover, effects of a program or policy. These studies usually assume that the underlying network is fixed or unaffected by the program. However, there has been some empirical evidence suggesting the treatment can also have significant affect on network. This paper analyzes the identification and estimation of causal treatment effects while explicitly considering possible network changes resulting from a program.
The main finding of this study is the decomposition of the causal effect into two distinct parts: the effect of treatment when the network remains unchanged and the effect when only the network structure is changed by the treatment. This contributes to the literature by enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms of a policy or program through the consideration of counterfactual scenarios in which the network is either changed or unchanged due to treatment.
The proposed method is applicable in quasi-experimental situations using a Difference-in-Differences approach, as well as in randomized experiments. A straightforward multi-step estimation procedure for the causal effects and their decompositions is introduced, and its performance is evaluated through a Monte Carlo study, and an empirical illustration.
