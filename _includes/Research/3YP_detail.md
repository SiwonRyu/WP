**Abstract:** This study analyzes the identification and estimation of causal effects in situations where units interact and treatment is endogenous due to imperfect compliance. In cases where units do not interact, monotonicity in potential treatments identifies local average treatment effects (LATE). When units interact, monotonicity can still apply, but additional restrictions on potential treatments, such as one-sided noncompliance or personalized encouragement, are typically required. This paper generalizes these restrictions into a weaker concept of monotonicity and provides a unified framework for this context. Direct and indirect LATEs are identified under strictly weaker restrictions on potential treatments compared to existing approaches, but with the assumption of an additional exclusion restriction for the endogenous treatment. A parametric estimator for causal effects is introduced, and its performance is evaluated through simulations. The estimator also assesses biases in existing methods when various underlying assumptions are violated. The estimation procedure is illustrated using an experimental study in Kenya, which provided access to a savings account.
