**Abstract:** Recent empirical studies emphasize the importance of indirect, or spillover, effects in program evaluation. Most studies assume that the underlying network is exogenous, fixed, or unaffected by the intervention. However, empirical evidence indicates that the treatment can also have significant network effects. This paper studies the identification and estimation of causal treatment effects while explicitly considering possible causal changes in the network resulting from a program. The main finding is the decomposition of the causal effects into two distinct components: the treatment effect when the network remains unchanged and the effect when the treatment alters only the network structure (network effect). This result enhances our understanding of policy/program mechanisms by considering counterfactual scenarios where the network is either altered or remains unchanged due to the treatment. The proposed method applies to both randomized experiments and quasi-experimental designs with parallel trends. A estimation procedure for causal effects and their decomposition is proposed, and its performance is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is illustrated using data from a program offering savings accounts. The empirical results show that total direct effect is small due to offsetting positive treatment effects and negative network effects.
