**Abstract:** This study examines identification and estimation in the presence of social interactions. Potential outcome depends on both an individual's own treatment and the exposures generated by others' treatment statuses and the underlying network structure. When the network itself is impacted by treatment, the individual's treatment can also alter these exposures. In such cases, the treatment effect can be decomposed into direct and indirect components. The direct effect represents the causal impact on the outcome when exposures are fixed, while  the indirect effect captures the influence of changes in the exposure distribution due to the individual's own treatment. As a result, observed exposures can be viewed as mediators of the individual's treatment effect. I employ a causal mediation framework to identify and decompose these effects and propose an estimation method. The performance of the estimator is then evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations, followed by an empirical application examining the impact of coeducational high schools on academic performance.
