**Abstract:** One of the Korean medical system characteristics is a dualized medical system in which western and Korean medical services coexist. Consumers' choices are made by maximizing their utility by considering two medical services' substitution or complementation relationship. We focus on this particular aspect of the Korean medical system and provide a new approach to analyzing the medical demand in a dual health care system using a structural economic theory. To this end, we use Grossman's model to develop a model for two medical services. We derive the demand function of medical service and its elasticities under the consumer's utility maximization problem. Also, we use Korea Health Panel data from 2015 to 2018 to empirically figure out medical demand functions by a random-effects model. For the patients who visited western and Korean medicine clinics for diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue, we find evidence that the medical demand is the necessity and decreasing in its price. In addition, consumers use two types of medical services as substitutes. Moreover, the demand is increasing in age and decreasing in the level of education. These are consistent with the theoretical prediction of the Grossman Model. This approach will enable the analysis of economic assessments of efficiency for the healthcare policies in a more rigorous way.
