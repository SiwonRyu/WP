**Abstract:** This study examines the impact of incorporating financial stability into monetary policy on the real economy, particularly in response to various macroeconomic shocks. Following the global financial crisis, the Bank of Korea explicitly began considering financial stability with the 2011 revision of the Bank of Korea Act. Traditional monetary policy, typically represented by the Taylor Rule, uses inflation and output gaps as information variables. In contrast, this study defines financial stability-oriented monetary policy as one that includes additional information variables related to the financial market, such as housing price and credit gaps. A general equilibrium model was established, incorporating credit frictions and collateral constraints, and its solutions were derived using method proposed by Uhlig (1999). Simulation results indicate that under financial stability-oriented monetary policy, the volatility of output and prices in response to shocks (interest rate, inflation, and housing price shocks) is reduced compared to traditional monetary policy. Consequently, welfare, measured as the weighted sum of the standard deviations of various variables, is improved, suggesting that monetary policy considering financial stability is socially more desirable than traditional approaches.
