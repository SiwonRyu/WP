**Abstract:** This study examines the impact of university locations on the college wage premium by using data from the Korea Education Employment Panel (KEEP) to analyze The effect of the treatment of college graduates in the Seoul area on the college wage premium is analyzed through the treatment group of university graduates in the Seoul area and the comparison group of university graduates in the Non-Seoul area to estimate the degree of difference in the college wage premium. In addition to the parametric method which is used in previous studies such as regression, Stochastic dominance testing is used to compare the whole distribution of target variable.
Main results are as follows. The wages of university graduates in Seoul were 8%(OLS), 14%(college fixed effects), 26%(Hausan-Taylorâ€™s IV estimator) higher when all other conditions were constant compared to those of college graduates in Non-Seoul. In addition, results of stochastic dominance tests showed that the hypothesis that the distribution of wages for graduates of universities in Non-Seoul first and second order stochastically dominate to those of college graduates in Seoul are rejected. Hence, we can conclude that the expected utility of college graduates in Seoul are higher than those of college graduates in Non-Seoul College wage premium for college graduates in different regions is due to the signal effect. This suggests that support policies for local universities would be more effective in a way that would ease information uncertainty to make companies screen students better, than direct support.
